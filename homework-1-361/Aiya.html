THE SONNETS<span id="line_12">&nbsp&nbsp[12]</span><br>
<span id="line_13">&nbsp&nbsp[13]</span><br>
by William Shakespeare<span id="line_14">&nbsp&nbsp[14]</span><br>
<span id="line_15">&nbsp&nbsp[15]</span><br>
<span id="line_16">&nbsp&nbsp[16]</span><br>
<span id="line_17">&nbsp&nbsp[17]</span><br>
                     1<span id="line_18">&nbsp&nbsp[18]</span><br>
  From fairest creatures we desire increase,<span id="line_19">&nbsp&nbsp[19]</span><br>
  That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<span id="line_20">&nbsp&nbsp[20]</span><br>
  But as the riper should by time decease,<span id="line_21">&nbsp&nbsp[21]</span><br>
  His tender heir might bear his memory:<span id="line_22">&nbsp&nbsp[22]</span><br>
  But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<span id="line_23">&nbsp&nbsp[23]</span><br>
  Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<span id="line_24">&nbsp&nbsp[24]</span><br>
  Making a famine where abundance lies,<span id="line_25">&nbsp&nbsp[25]</span><br>
  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<span id="line_26">&nbsp&nbsp[26]</span><br>
  Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,<span id="line_27">&nbsp&nbsp[27]</span><br>
  And only herald to the gaudy spring,<span id="line_28">&nbsp&nbsp[28]</span><br>
  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<span id="line_29">&nbsp&nbsp[29]</span><br>
  And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:<span id="line_30">&nbsp&nbsp[30]</span><br>
    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<span id="line_31">&nbsp&nbsp[31]</span><br>
    To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.<span id="line_32">&nbsp&nbsp[32]</span><br>
<span id="line_33">&nbsp&nbsp[33]</span><br>
<span id="line_34">&nbsp&nbsp[34]</span><br>
                     2<span id="line_35">&nbsp&nbsp[35]</span><br>
  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<span id="line_36">&nbsp&nbsp[36]</span><br>
  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<span id="line_37">&nbsp&nbsp[37]</span><br>
  Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,<span id="line_38">&nbsp&nbsp[38]</span><br>
  Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:  <span id="line_39">&nbsp&nbsp[39]</span><br>
  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<span id="line_40">&nbsp&nbsp[40]</span><br>
  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<span id="line_41">&nbsp&nbsp[41]</span><br>
  To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,<span id="line_42">&nbsp&nbsp[42]</span><br>
  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<span id="line_43">&nbsp&nbsp[43]</span><br>
  How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,<span id="line_44">&nbsp&nbsp[44]</span><br>
  If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<span id="line_45">&nbsp&nbsp[45]</span><br>
  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'<span id="line_46">&nbsp&nbsp[46]</span><br>
  Proving his beauty by succession thine.<span id="line_47">&nbsp&nbsp[47]</span><br>
    This were to be new made when thou art old,<span id="line_48">&nbsp&nbsp[48]</span><br>
    And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.<span id="line_49">&nbsp&nbsp[49]</span><br>
<span id="line_50">&nbsp&nbsp[50]</span><br>
<span id="line_51">&nbsp&nbsp[51]</span><br>
                     3<span id="line_52">&nbsp&nbsp[52]</span><br>
  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,<span id="line_53">&nbsp&nbsp[53]</span><br>
  Now is the time that face should form another,<span id="line_54">&nbsp&nbsp[54]</span><br>
  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<span id="line_55">&nbsp&nbsp[55]</span><br>
  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<span id="line_56">&nbsp&nbsp[56]</span><br>
  For where is she so fair whose uneared womb<span id="line_57">&nbsp&nbsp[57]</span><br>
  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<span id="line_58">&nbsp&nbsp[58]</span><br>
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,<span id="line_59">&nbsp&nbsp[59]</span><br>
  Of his self-love to stop posterity?  <span id="line_60">&nbsp&nbsp[60]</span><br>
  Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee<span id="line_61">&nbsp&nbsp[61]</span><br>
  Calls back the lovely April of her prime,<span id="line_62">&nbsp&nbsp[62]</span><br>
  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<span id="line_63">&nbsp&nbsp[63]</span><br>
  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<span id="line_64">&nbsp&nbsp[64]</span><br>
    But if thou live remembered not to be,<span id="line_65">&nbsp&nbsp[65]</span><br>
    Die single and thine image dies with thee.<span id="line_66">&nbsp&nbsp[66]</span><br>
<span id="line_67">&nbsp&nbsp[67]</span><br>
<span id="line_68">&nbsp&nbsp[68]</span><br>
                     4<span id="line_69">&nbsp&nbsp[69]</span><br>
  Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,<span id="line_70">&nbsp&nbsp[70]</span><br>
  Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?<span id="line_71">&nbsp&nbsp[71]</span><br>
  Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,<span id="line_72">&nbsp&nbsp[72]</span><br>
  And being frank she lends to those are free:<span id="line_73">&nbsp&nbsp[73]</span><br>
  Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,<span id="line_74">&nbsp&nbsp[74]</span><br>
  The bounteous largess given thee to give?<span id="line_75">&nbsp&nbsp[75]</span><br>
  Profitless usurer why dost thou use<span id="line_76">&nbsp&nbsp[76]</span><br>
  So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?<span id="line_77">&nbsp&nbsp[77]</span><br>
  For having traffic with thy self alone,<span id="line_78">&nbsp&nbsp[78]</span><br>
  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,<span id="line_79">&nbsp&nbsp[79]</span><br>
  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,<span id="line_80">&nbsp&nbsp[80]</span><br>
  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?  <span id="line_81">&nbsp&nbsp[81]</span><br>
    Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,<span id="line_82">&nbsp&nbsp[82]</span><br>
    Which used lives th' executor to be.<span id="line_83">&nbsp&nbsp[83]</span><br>
<span id="line_84">&nbsp&nbsp[84]</span><br>
<span id="line_85">&nbsp&nbsp[85]</span><br>
                     5<span id="line_86">&nbsp&nbsp[86]</span><br>
  Those hours that with gentle work did frame<span id="line_87">&nbsp&nbsp[87]</span><br>
  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell<span id="line_88">&nbsp&nbsp[88]</span><br>
  Will play the tyrants to the very same,<span id="line_89">&nbsp&nbsp[89]</span><br>
  And that unfair which fairly doth excel:<span id="line_90">&nbsp&nbsp[90]</span><br>
  For never-resting time leads summer on<span id="line_91">&nbsp&nbsp[91]</span><br>
  To hideous winter and confounds him there,<span id="line_92">&nbsp&nbsp[92]</span><br>
  Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,<span id="line_93">&nbsp&nbsp[93]</span><br>
  Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:<span id="line_94">&nbsp&nbsp[94]</span><br>
  Then were not summer's distillation left<span id="line_95">&nbsp&nbsp[95]</span><br>
  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<span id="line_96">&nbsp&nbsp[96]</span><br>
  Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,<span id="line_97">&nbsp&nbsp[97]</span><br>
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.<span id="line_98">&nbsp&nbsp[98]</span><br>
    But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,<span id="line_99">&nbsp&nbsp[99]</span><br>
    Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.<span id="line_100">&nbsp&nbsp[100]</span><br>
<span id="line_101">&nbsp&nbsp[101]</span><br>
<span id="line_102">&nbsp&nbsp[102]</span><br>
                     6  <span id="line_103">&nbsp&nbsp[103]</span><br>
  Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,<span id="line_104">&nbsp&nbsp[104]</span><br>
  In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:<span id="line_105">&nbsp&nbsp[105]</span><br>
  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,<span id="line_106">&nbsp&nbsp[106]</span><br>
  With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:<span id="line_107">&nbsp&nbsp[107]</span><br>
  That use is not forbidden usury,<span id="line_108">&nbsp&nbsp[108]</span><br>
  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;<span id="line_109">&nbsp&nbsp[109]</span><br>
  That's for thy self to breed another thee,<span id="line_110">&nbsp&nbsp[110]</span><br>
  Or ten times happier be it ten for one,<span id="line_111">&nbsp&nbsp[111]</span><br>
  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,<span id="line_112">&nbsp&nbsp[112]</span><br>
  If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:<span id="line_113">&nbsp&nbsp[113]</span><br>
  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,<span id="line_114">&nbsp&nbsp[114]</span><br>
  Leaving thee living in posterity?<span id="line_115">&nbsp&nbsp[115]</span><br>
    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,<span id="line_116">&nbsp&nbsp[116]</span><br>
    To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.<span id="line_117">&nbsp&nbsp[117]</span><br>
<span id="line_118">&nbsp&nbsp[118]</span><br>
<span id="line_119">&nbsp&nbsp[119]</span><br>
                     7<span id="line_120">&nbsp&nbsp[120]</span><br>
  Lo in the orient when the gracious light<span id="line_121">&nbsp&nbsp[121]</span><br>
  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye<span id="line_122">&nbsp&nbsp[122]</span><br>
  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,<span id="line_123">&nbsp&nbsp[123]</span><br>
  Serving with looks his sacred majesty,  <span id="line_124">&nbsp&nbsp[124]</span><br>
  And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,<span id="line_125">&nbsp&nbsp[125]</span><br>
  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,<span id="line_126">&nbsp&nbsp[126]</span><br>
  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,<span id="line_127">&nbsp&nbsp[127]</span><br>
  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:<span id="line_128">&nbsp&nbsp[128]</span><br>
  But when from highmost pitch with weary car,<span id="line_129">&nbsp&nbsp[129]</span><br>
  Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,<span id="line_130">&nbsp&nbsp[130]</span><br>
  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are<span id="line_131">&nbsp&nbsp[131]</span><br>
  From his low tract and look another way:<span id="line_132">&nbsp&nbsp[132]</span><br>
    So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:<span id="line_133">&nbsp&nbsp[133]</span><br>
    Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.<span id="line_134">&nbsp&nbsp[134]</span><br>
<span id="line_135">&nbsp&nbsp[135]</span><br>
<span id="line_136">&nbsp&nbsp[136]</span><br>
                     8<span id="line_137">&nbsp&nbsp[137]</span><br>
  Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?<span id="line_138">&nbsp&nbsp[138]</span><br>
  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:<span id="line_139">&nbsp&nbsp[139]</span><br>
  Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,<span id="line_140">&nbsp&nbsp[140]</span><br>
  Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?<span id="line_141">&nbsp&nbsp[141]</span><br>
  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,<span id="line_142">&nbsp&nbsp[142]</span><br>
  By unions married do offend thine ear,<span id="line_143">&nbsp&nbsp[143]</span><br>
  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds<span id="line_144">&nbsp&nbsp[144]</span><br>
  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:  <span id="line_145">&nbsp&nbsp[145]</span><br>
  Mark how one string sweet husband to another,<span id="line_146">&nbsp&nbsp[146]</span><br>
  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;<span id="line_147">&nbsp&nbsp[147]</span><br>
  Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,<span id="line_148">&nbsp&nbsp[148]</span><br>
  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:<span id="line_149">&nbsp&nbsp[149]</span><br>
    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,<span id="line_150">&nbsp&nbsp[150]</span><br>
    Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.<span id="line_151">&nbsp&nbsp[151]</span><br>
<span id="line_152">&nbsp&nbsp[152]</span><br>
<span id="line_153">&nbsp&nbsp[153]</span><br>
                     9<span id="line_154">&nbsp&nbsp[154]</span><br>
  Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,<span id="line_155">&nbsp&nbsp[155]</span><br>
  That thou consum'st thy self in single life?<span id="line_156">&nbsp&nbsp[156]</span><br>
  Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,<span id="line_157">&nbsp&nbsp[157]</span><br>
  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,<span id="line_158">&nbsp&nbsp[158]</span><br>
  The world will be thy widow and still weep,<span id="line_159">&nbsp&nbsp[159]</span><br>
  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,<span id="line_160">&nbsp&nbsp[160]</span><br>
  When every private widow well may keep,<span id="line_161">&nbsp&nbsp[161]</span><br>
  By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:<span id="line_162">&nbsp&nbsp[162]</span><br>
  Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend<span id="line_163">&nbsp&nbsp[163]</span><br>
  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;<span id="line_164">&nbsp&nbsp[164]</span><br>
  But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,<span id="line_165">&nbsp&nbsp[165]</span><br>
  And kept unused the user so destroys it:  <span id="line_166">&nbsp&nbsp[166]</span><br>
    No love toward others in that bosom sits<span id="line_167">&nbsp&nbsp[167]</span><br>
    That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.<span id="line_168">&nbsp&nbsp[168]</span><br>
<span id="line_169">&nbsp&nbsp[169]</span><br>
<span id="line_170">&nbsp&nbsp[170]</span><br>
                     10<span id="line_171">&nbsp&nbsp[171]</span><br>
  For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any<span id="line_172">&nbsp&nbsp[172]</span><br>
  Who for thy self art so unprovident.<span id="line_173">&nbsp&nbsp[173]</span><br>
  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,<span id="line_174">&nbsp&nbsp[174]</span><br>
  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:<span id="line_175">&nbsp&nbsp[175]</span><br>
  For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,<span id="line_176">&nbsp&nbsp[176]</span><br>
  That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,<span id="line_177">&nbsp&nbsp[177]</span><br>
  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate<span id="line_178">&nbsp&nbsp[178]</span><br>
  Which to repair should be thy chief desire:<span id="line_179">&nbsp&nbsp[179]</span><br>
  O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,<span id="line_180">&nbsp&nbsp[180]</span><br>
  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?<span id="line_181">&nbsp&nbsp[181]</span><br>
  Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,<span id="line_182">&nbsp&nbsp[182]</span><br>
  Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,<span id="line_183">&nbsp&nbsp[183]</span><br>
    Make thee another self for love of me,<span id="line_184">&nbsp&nbsp[184]</span><br>
    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.<span id="line_185">&nbsp&nbsp[185]</span><br>
<span id="line_186">&nbsp&nbsp[186]</span><br>
<span id="line_187">&nbsp&nbsp[187]</span><br>
                     11  <span id="line_188">&nbsp&nbsp[188]</span><br>
  As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,<span id="line_189">&nbsp&nbsp[189]</span><br>
  In one of thine, from that which thou departest,<span id="line_190">&nbsp&nbsp[190]</span><br>
  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,<span id="line_191">&nbsp&nbsp[191]</span><br>
  Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,<span id="line_192">&nbsp&nbsp[192]</span><br>
  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,<span id="line_193">&nbsp&nbsp[193]</span><br>
  Without this folly, age, and cold decay,<span id="line_194">&nbsp&nbsp[194]</span><br>
  If all were minded so, the times should cease,<span id="line_195">&nbsp&nbsp[195]</span><br>
  And threescore year would make the world away:<span id="line_196">&nbsp&nbsp[196]</span><br>
  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,<span id="line_197">&nbsp&nbsp[197]</span><br>
  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:<span id="line_198">&nbsp&nbsp[198]</span><br>
  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;<span id="line_199">&nbsp&nbsp[199]</span><br>
  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:<span id="line_200">&nbsp&nbsp[200]</span><br>
    She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,<span id="line_201">&nbsp&nbsp[201]</span><br>
    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.<span id="line_202">&nbsp&nbsp[202]</span><br>
<span id="line_203">&nbsp&nbsp[203]</span><br>
<span id="line_204">&nbsp&nbsp[204]</span><br>
                     12<span id="line_205">&nbsp&nbsp[205]</span><br>
  When I do count the clock that tells the time,<span id="line_206">&nbsp&nbsp[206]</span><br>
  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,<span id="line_207">&nbsp&nbsp[207]</span><br>
  When I behold the violet past prime,<span id="line_208">&nbsp&nbsp[208]</span><br>
  And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:  <span id="line_209">&nbsp&nbsp[209]</span><br>
  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,<span id="line_210">&nbsp&nbsp[210]</span><br>
  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd<span id="line_211">&nbsp&nbsp[211]</span><br>
  And summer's green all girded up in sheaves<span id="line_212">&nbsp&nbsp[212]</span><br>
  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:<span id="line_213">&nbsp&nbsp[213]</span><br>
  Then of thy beauty do I question make<span id="line_214">&nbsp&nbsp[214]</span><br>
  That thou among the wastes of time must go,<span id="line_215">&nbsp&nbsp[215]</span><br>
  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,<span id="line_216">&nbsp&nbsp[216]</span><br>
  And die as fast as they see others grow,<span id="line_217">&nbsp&nbsp[217]</span><br>
    And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence<span id="line_218">&nbsp&nbsp[218]</span><br>
    Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.<span id="line_219">&nbsp&nbsp[219]</span><br>
<span id="line_220">&nbsp&nbsp[220]</span><br>
<span id="line_221">&nbsp&nbsp[221]</span><br>
                     13<span id="line_222">&nbsp&nbsp[222]</span><br>
  O that you were your self, but love you are<span id="line_223">&nbsp&nbsp[223]</span><br>
  No longer yours, than you your self here live,<span id="line_224">&nbsp&nbsp[224]</span><br>
  Against this coming end you should prepare,<span id="line_225">&nbsp&nbsp[225]</span><br>
  And your sweet semblance to some other give.<span id="line_226">&nbsp&nbsp[226]</span><br>
  So should that beauty which you hold in lease<span id="line_227">&nbsp&nbsp[227]</span><br>
  Find no determination, then you were<span id="line_228">&nbsp&nbsp[228]</span><br>
  Your self again after your self's decease,<span id="line_229">&nbsp&nbsp[229]</span><br>
  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.  <span id="line_230">&nbsp&nbsp[230]</span><br>
  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,<span id="line_231">&nbsp&nbsp[231]</span><br>
  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,<span id="line_232">&nbsp&nbsp[232]</span><br>
  Against the stormy gusts of winter's day<span id="line_233">&nbsp&nbsp[233]</span><br>
  And barren rage of death's eternal cold?<span id="line_234">&nbsp&nbsp[234]</span><br>
    O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,<span id="line_235">&nbsp&nbsp[235]</span><br>
    You had a father, let your son say so.<span id="line_236">&nbsp&nbsp[236]</span><br>
<span id="line_237">&nbsp&nbsp[237]</span><br>
<span id="line_238">&nbsp&nbsp[238]</span><br>
                     14<span id="line_239">&nbsp&nbsp[239]</span><br>
  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,<span id="line_240">&nbsp&nbsp[240]</span><br>
  And yet methinks I have astronomy,<span id="line_241">&nbsp&nbsp[241]</span><br>
  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,<span id="line_242">&nbsp&nbsp[242]</span><br>
  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,<span id="line_243">&nbsp&nbsp[243]</span><br>
  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;<span id="line_244">&nbsp&nbsp[244]</span><br>
  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,<span id="line_245">&nbsp&nbsp[245]</span><br>
  Or say with princes if it shall go well<span id="line_246">&nbsp&nbsp[246]</span><br>
  By oft predict that I in heaven find.<span id="line_247">&nbsp&nbsp[247]</span><br>
  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,<span id="line_248">&nbsp&nbsp[248]</span><br>
  And constant stars in them I read such art<span id="line_249">&nbsp&nbsp[249]</span><br>
  As truth and beauty shall together thrive<span id="line_250">&nbsp&nbsp[250]</span><br>
  If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:  <span id="line_251">&nbsp&nbsp[251]</span><br>
    Or else of thee this I prognosticate,<span id="line_252">&nbsp&nbsp[252]</span><br>
    Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.<span id="line_253">&nbsp&nbsp[253]</span><br>
<span id="line_254">&nbsp&nbsp[254]</span><br>
<span id="line_255">&nbsp&nbsp[255]</span><br>
                     15<span id="line_256">&nbsp&nbsp[256]</span><br>
  When I consider every thing that grows<span id="line_257">&nbsp&nbsp[257]</span><br>
  Holds in perfection but a little moment.<span id="line_258">&nbsp&nbsp[258]</span><br>
  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows<span id="line_259">&nbsp&nbsp[259]</span><br>
  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.<span id="line_260">&nbsp&nbsp[260]</span><br>
  When I perceive that men as plants increase,<span id="line_261">&nbsp&nbsp[261]</span><br>
  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:<span id="line_262">&nbsp&nbsp[262]</span><br>
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,<span id="line_263">&nbsp&nbsp[263]</span><br>
  And wear their brave state out of memory.<span id="line_264">&nbsp&nbsp[264]</span><br>
  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,<span id="line_265">&nbsp&nbsp[265]</span><br>
  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,<span id="line_266">&nbsp&nbsp[266]</span><br>
  Where wasteful time debateth with decay<span id="line_267">&nbsp&nbsp[267]</span><br>
  To change your day of youth to sullied night,<span id="line_268">&nbsp&nbsp[268]</span><br>
    And all in war with Time for love of you,<span id="line_269">&nbsp&nbsp[269]</span><br>
    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.<span id="line_270">&nbsp&nbsp[270]</span><br>
<span id="line_271">&nbsp&nbsp[271]</span><br>
<span id="line_272">&nbsp&nbsp[272]</span><br>
                     16  <span id="line_273">&nbsp&nbsp[273]</span><br>
  But wherefore do not you a mightier way<span id="line_274">&nbsp&nbsp[274]</span><br>
  Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?<span id="line_275">&nbsp&nbsp[275]</span><br>
  And fortify your self in your decay<span id="line_276">&nbsp&nbsp[276]</span><br>
  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?<span id="line_277">&nbsp&nbsp[277]</span><br>
  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,<span id="line_278">&nbsp&nbsp[278]</span><br>
  And many maiden gardens yet unset,<span id="line_279">&nbsp&nbsp[279]</span><br>
  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,<span id="line_280">&nbsp&nbsp[280]</span><br>
  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:<span id="line_281">&nbsp&nbsp[281]</span><br>
  So should the lines of life that life repair<span id="line_282">&nbsp&nbsp[282]</span><br>
  Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen<span id="line_283">&nbsp&nbsp[283]</span><br>
  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair<span id="line_284">&nbsp&nbsp[284]</span><br>
  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.<span id="line_285">&nbsp&nbsp[285]</span><br>
    To give away your self, keeps your self still,<span id="line_286">&nbsp&nbsp[286]</span><br>
    And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.<span id="line_287">&nbsp&nbsp[287]</span><br>
<span id="line_288">&nbsp&nbsp[288]</span><br>
<span id="line_289">&nbsp&nbsp[289]</span><br>
                     17<span id="line_290">&nbsp&nbsp[290]</span><br>
  Who will believe my verse in time to come<span id="line_291">&nbsp&nbsp[291]</span><br>
  If it were filled with your most high deserts?<span id="line_292">&nbsp&nbsp[292]</span><br>
  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb<span id="line_293">&nbsp&nbsp[293]</span><br>
  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:  <span id="line_294">&nbsp&nbsp[294]</span><br>
  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,<span id="line_295">&nbsp&nbsp[295]</span><br>
  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,<span id="line_296">&nbsp&nbsp[296]</span><br>
  The age to come would say this poet lies,<span id="line_297">&nbsp&nbsp[297]</span><br>
  Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.<span id="line_298">&nbsp&nbsp[298]</span><br>
  So should my papers (yellowed with their age)<span id="line_299">&nbsp&nbsp[299]</span><br>
  Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,<span id="line_300">&nbsp&nbsp[300]</span><br>
  And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,<span id="line_301">&nbsp&nbsp[301]</span><br>
  And stretched metre of an antique song.<span id="line_302">&nbsp&nbsp[302]</span><br>
    But were some child of yours alive that time,<span id="line_303">&nbsp&nbsp[303]</span><br>
    You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.<span id="line_304">&nbsp&nbsp[304]</span><br>
<span id="line_305">&nbsp&nbsp[305]</span><br>
<span id="line_306">&nbsp&nbsp[306]</span><br>
                     18<span id="line_307">&nbsp&nbsp[307]</span><br>
  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<span id="line_308">&nbsp&nbsp[308]</span><br>
  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<span id="line_309">&nbsp&nbsp[309]</span><br>
  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<span id="line_310">&nbsp&nbsp[310]</span><br>
  And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<span id="line_311">&nbsp&nbsp[311]</span><br>
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<span id="line_312">&nbsp&nbsp[312]</span><br>
  And often is his gold complexion dimmed,<span id="line_313">&nbsp&nbsp[313]</span><br>
  And every fair from fair sometime declines,<span id="line_314">&nbsp&nbsp[314]</span><br>
  By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:  <span id="line_315">&nbsp&nbsp[315]</span><br>
  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<span id="line_316">&nbsp&nbsp[316]</span><br>
  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,<span id="line_317">&nbsp&nbsp[317]</span><br>
  Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,<span id="line_318">&nbsp&nbsp[318]</span><br>
  When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,<span id="line_319">&nbsp&nbsp[319]</span><br>
    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<span id="line_320">&nbsp&nbsp[320]</span><br>
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<span id="line_321">&nbsp&nbsp[321]</span><br>
<span id="line_322">&nbsp&nbsp[322]</span><br>
<span id="line_323">&nbsp&nbsp[323]</span><br>
                     19<span id="line_324">&nbsp&nbsp[324]</span><br>
  Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws,<span id="line_325">&nbsp&nbsp[325]</span><br>
  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,<span id="line_326">&nbsp&nbsp[326]</span><br>
  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,<span id="line_327">&nbsp&nbsp[327]</span><br>
  And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,<span id="line_328">&nbsp&nbsp[328]</span><br>
  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,<span id="line_329">&nbsp&nbsp[329]</span><br>
  And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time<span id="line_330">&nbsp&nbsp[330]</span><br>
  To the wide world and all her fading sweets:<span id="line_331">&nbsp&nbsp[331]</span><br>
  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,<span id="line_332">&nbsp&nbsp[332]</span><br>
  O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,<span id="line_333">&nbsp&nbsp[333]</span><br>
  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,<span id="line_334">&nbsp&nbsp[334]</span><br>
  Him in thy course untainted do allow,<span id="line_335">&nbsp&nbsp[335]</span><br>
  For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.  <span id="line_336">&nbsp&nbsp[336]</span><br>
    Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,<span id="line_337">&nbsp&nbsp[337]</span><br>
    My love shall in my verse ever live young.<span id="line_338">&nbsp&nbsp[338]</span><br>
<span id="line_339">&nbsp&nbsp[339]</span><br>
<span id="line_340">&nbsp&nbsp[340]</span><br>
                     20<span id="line_341">&nbsp&nbsp[341]</span><br>
  A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,<span id="line_342">&nbsp&nbsp[342]</span><br>
  Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,<span id="line_343">&nbsp&nbsp[343]</span><br>
  A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted<span id="line_344">&nbsp&nbsp[344]</span><br>
  With shifting change as is false women's fashion,<span id="line_345">&nbsp&nbsp[345]</span><br>
  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:<span id="line_346">&nbsp&nbsp[346]</span><br>
  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,<span id="line_347">&nbsp&nbsp[347]</span><br>
  A man in hue all hues in his controlling,<span id="line_348">&nbsp&nbsp[348]</span><br>
  Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.<span id="line_349">&nbsp&nbsp[349]</span><br>
  And for a woman wert thou first created,<span id="line_350">&nbsp&nbsp[350]</span><br>
  Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,<span id="line_351">&nbsp&nbsp[351]</span><br>
  And by addition me of thee defeated,<span id="line_352">&nbsp&nbsp[352]</span><br>
  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.<span id="line_353">&nbsp&nbsp[353]</span><br>
    But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,<span id="line_354">&nbsp&nbsp[354]</span><br>
    Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.<span id="line_355">&nbsp&nbsp[355]</span><br>
<span id="line_356">&nbsp&nbsp[356]</span><br>
<span id="line_357">&nbsp&nbsp[357]</span><br>
                     21  <span id="line_358">&nbsp&nbsp[358]</span><br>
  So is it not with me as with that muse,<span id="line_359">&nbsp&nbsp[359]</span><br>
  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,<span id="line_360">&nbsp&nbsp[360]</span><br>
  Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,<span id="line_361">&nbsp&nbsp[361]</span><br>
  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,<span id="line_362">&nbsp&nbsp[362]</span><br>
  Making a couplement of proud compare<span id="line_363">&nbsp&nbsp[363]</span><br>
  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:<span id="line_364">&nbsp&nbsp[364]</span><br>
  With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,<span id="line_365">&nbsp&nbsp[365]</span><br>
  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.<span id="line_366">&nbsp&nbsp[366]</span><br>
  O let me true in love but truly write,<span id="line_367">&nbsp&nbsp[367]</span><br>
  And then believe me, my love is as fair,<span id="line_368">&nbsp&nbsp[368]</span><br>
  As any mother's child, though not so bright<span id="line_369">&nbsp&nbsp[369]</span><br>
  As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:<span id="line_370">&nbsp&nbsp[370]</span><br>
    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,<span id="line_371">&nbsp&nbsp[371]</span><br>
    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.<span id="line_372">&nbsp&nbsp[372]</span><br>
<span id="line_373">&nbsp&nbsp[373]</span><br>
<span id="line_374">&nbsp&nbsp[374]</span><br>
                     22<span id="line_375">&nbsp&nbsp[375]</span><br>
  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,<span id="line_376">&nbsp&nbsp[376]</span><br>
  So long as youth and thou are of one date,<span id="line_377">&nbsp&nbsp[377]</span><br>
  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,<span id="line_378">&nbsp&nbsp[378]</span><br>
  Then look I death my days should expiate.  <span id="line_379">&nbsp&nbsp[379]</span><br>
  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,<span id="line_380">&nbsp&nbsp[380]</span><br>
  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,<span id="line_381">&nbsp&nbsp[381]</span><br>
  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,<span id="line_382">&nbsp&nbsp[382]</span><br>
  How can I then be elder than thou art?<span id="line_383">&nbsp&nbsp[383]</span><br>
  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,<span id="line_384">&nbsp&nbsp[384]</span><br>
  As I not for my self, but for thee will,<span id="line_385">&nbsp&nbsp[385]</span><br>
  Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary<span id="line_386">&nbsp&nbsp[386]</span><br>
  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.<span id="line_387">&nbsp&nbsp[387]</span><br>
    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,<span id="line_388">&nbsp&nbsp[388]</span><br>
    Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.<span id="line_389">&nbsp&nbsp[389]</span><br>
<span id="line_390">&nbsp&nbsp[390]</span><br>
<span id="line_391">&nbsp&nbsp[391]</span><br>
                     23<span id="line_392">&nbsp&nbsp[392]</span><br>
  As an unperfect actor on the stage,<span id="line_393">&nbsp&nbsp[393]</span><br>
  Who with his fear is put beside his part,<span id="line_394">&nbsp&nbsp[394]</span><br>
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,<span id="line_395">&nbsp&nbsp[395]</span><br>
  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;<span id="line_396">&nbsp&nbsp[396]</span><br>
  So I for fear of trust, forget to say,<span id="line_397">&nbsp&nbsp[397]</span><br>
  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,<span id="line_398">&nbsp&nbsp[398]</span><br>
  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,<span id="line_399">&nbsp&nbsp[399]</span><br>
  O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:  <span id="line_400">&nbsp&nbsp[400]</span><br>
  O let my looks be then the eloquence,<span id="line_401">&nbsp&nbsp[401]</span><br>
  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,<span id="line_402">&nbsp&nbsp[402]</span><br>
  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,<span id="line_403">&nbsp&nbsp[403]</span><br>
  More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.<span id="line_404">&nbsp&nbsp[404]</span><br>
    O learn to read what silent love hath writ,<span id="line_405">&nbsp&nbsp[405]</span><br>
    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.<span id="line_406">&nbsp&nbsp[406]</span><br>
<span id="line_407">&nbsp&nbsp[407]</span><br>
<span id="line_408">&nbsp&nbsp[408]</span><br>
                     24<span id="line_409">&nbsp&nbsp[409]</span><br>
  Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,<span id="line_410">&nbsp&nbsp[410]</span><br>
  Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,<span id="line_411">&nbsp&nbsp[411]</span><br>
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,<span id="line_412">&nbsp&nbsp[412]</span><br>
  And perspective it is best painter's art.<span id="line_413">&nbsp&nbsp[413]</span><br>
  For through the painter must you see his skill,<span id="line_414">&nbsp&nbsp[414]</span><br>
  To find where your true image pictured lies,<span id="line_415">&nbsp&nbsp[415]</span><br>
  Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,<span id="line_416">&nbsp&nbsp[416]</span><br>
  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:<span id="line_417">&nbsp&nbsp[417]</span><br>
  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,<span id="line_418">&nbsp&nbsp[418]</span><br>
  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me<span id="line_419">&nbsp&nbsp[419]</span><br>
  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun<span id="line_420">&nbsp&nbsp[420]</span><br>
  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;  <span id="line_421">&nbsp&nbsp[421]</span><br>
    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,<span id="line_422">&nbsp&nbsp[422]</span><br>
    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.<span id="line_423">&nbsp&nbsp[423]</span><br>
<span id="line_424">&nbsp&nbsp[424]</span><br>
<span id="line_425">&nbsp&nbsp[425]</span><br>
                     25<span id="line_426">&nbsp&nbsp[426]</span><br>
  Let those who are in favour with their stars,<span id="line_427">&nbsp&nbsp[427]</span><br>
  Of public honour and proud titles boast,<span id="line_428">&nbsp&nbsp[428]</span><br>
  Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars<span id="line_429">&nbsp&nbsp[429]</span><br>
  Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;<span id="line_430">&nbsp&nbsp[430]</span><br>
  Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,<span id="line_431">&nbsp&nbsp[431]</span><br>
  But as the marigold at the sun's eye,<span id="line_432">&nbsp&nbsp[432]</span><br>
  And in themselves their pride lies buried,<span id="line_433">&nbsp&nbsp[433]</span><br>
  For at a frown they in their glory die.<span id="line_434">&nbsp&nbsp[434]</span><br>
  The painful warrior famoused for fight,<span id="line_435">&nbsp&nbsp[435]</span><br>
  After a thousand victories once foiled,<span id="line_436">&nbsp&nbsp[436]</span><br>
  Is from the book of honour razed quite,<span id="line_437">&nbsp&nbsp[437]</span><br>
  And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:<span id="line_438">&nbsp&nbsp[438]</span><br>
    Then happy I that love and am beloved<span id="line_439">&nbsp&nbsp[439]</span><br>
    Where I may not remove nor be removed.<span id="line_440">&nbsp&nbsp[440]</span><br>
<span id="line_441">&nbsp&nbsp[441]</span><br>
<span id="line_442">&nbsp&nbsp[442]</span><br>
                     26  <span id="line_443">&nbsp&nbsp[443]</span><br>
  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage<span id="line_444">&nbsp&nbsp[444]</span><br>
  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;<span id="line_445">&nbsp&nbsp[445]</span><br>
  To thee I send this written embassage<span id="line_446">&nbsp&nbsp[446]</span><br>
  To witness duty, not to show my wit.<span id="line_447">&nbsp&nbsp[447]</span><br>
  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine<span id="line_448">&nbsp&nbsp[448]</span><br>
  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;<span id="line_449">&nbsp&nbsp[449]</span><br>
  But that I hope some good conceit of thine<span id="line_450">&nbsp&nbsp[450]</span><br>
  In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it:<span id="line_451">&nbsp&nbsp[451]</span><br>
  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,<span id="line_452">&nbsp&nbsp[452]</span><br>
  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,<span id="line_453">&nbsp&nbsp[453]</span><br>
  And puts apparel on my tattered loving,<span id="line_454">&nbsp&nbsp[454]</span><br>
  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,<span id="line_455">&nbsp&nbsp[455]</span><br>
    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,<span id="line_456">&nbsp&nbsp[456]</span><br>
    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.<span id="line_457">&nbsp&nbsp[457]</span><br>
<span id="line_458">&nbsp&nbsp[458]</span><br>
<span id="line_459">&nbsp&nbsp[459]</span><br>
                     27<span id="line_460">&nbsp&nbsp[460]</span><br>
  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,<span id="line_461">&nbsp&nbsp[461]</span><br>
  The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,<span id="line_462">&nbsp&nbsp[462]</span><br>
  But then begins a journey in my head<span id="line_463">&nbsp&nbsp[463]</span><br>
  To work my mind, when body's work's expired.  <span id="line_464">&nbsp&nbsp[464]</span><br>
  For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)<span id="line_465">&nbsp&nbsp[465]</span><br>
  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,<span id="line_466">&nbsp&nbsp[466]</span><br>
  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,<span id="line_467">&nbsp&nbsp[467]</span><br>
  Looking on darkness which the blind do see.<span id="line_468">&nbsp&nbsp[468]</span><br>
  Save that my soul's imaginary sight<span id="line_469">&nbsp&nbsp[469]</span><br>
  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<span id="line_470">&nbsp&nbsp[470]</span><br>
  Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)<span id="line_471">&nbsp&nbsp[471]</span><br>
  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.<span id="line_472">&nbsp&nbsp[472]</span><br>
    Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,<span id="line_473">&nbsp&nbsp[473]</span><br>
    For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.<span id="line_474">&nbsp&nbsp[474]</span><br>
<span id="line_475">&nbsp&nbsp[475]</span><br>
<span id="line_476">&nbsp&nbsp[476]</span><br>
                     28<span id="line_477">&nbsp&nbsp[477]</span><br>
  How can I then return in happy plight<span id="line_478">&nbsp&nbsp[478]</span><br>
  That am debarred the benefit of rest?<span id="line_479">&nbsp&nbsp[479]</span><br>
  When day's oppression is not eased by night,<span id="line_480">&nbsp&nbsp[480]</span><br>
  But day by night and night by day oppressed.<span id="line_481">&nbsp&nbsp[481]</span><br>
  And each (though enemies to either's reign)<span id="line_482">&nbsp&nbsp[482]</span><br>
  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,<span id="line_483">&nbsp&nbsp[483]</span><br>
  The one by toil, the other to complain<span id="line_484">&nbsp&nbsp[484]</span><br>
  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.  <span id="line_485">&nbsp&nbsp[485]</span><br>
  I tell the day to please him thou art bright,<span id="line_486">&nbsp&nbsp[486]</span><br>
  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:<span id="line_487">&nbsp&nbsp[487]</span><br>
  So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,<span id="line_488">&nbsp&nbsp[488]</span><br>
  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.<span id="line_489">&nbsp&nbsp[489]</span><br>
    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,<span id="line_490">&nbsp&nbsp[490]</span><br>
    And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger<span id="line_491">&nbsp&nbsp[491]</span><br>
<span id="line_492">&nbsp&nbsp[492]</span><br>
<span id="line_493">&nbsp&nbsp[493]</span><br>
                     29<span id="line_494">&nbsp&nbsp[494]</span><br>
  When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,<span id="line_495">&nbsp&nbsp[495]</span><br>
  I all alone beweep my outcast state,<span id="line_496">&nbsp&nbsp[496]</span><br>
  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,<span id="line_497">&nbsp&nbsp[497]</span><br>
  And look upon my self and curse my fate,<span id="line_498">&nbsp&nbsp[498]</span><br>
  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<span id="line_499">&nbsp&nbsp[499]</span><br>
  Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,<span id="line_500">&nbsp&nbsp[500]</span><br>
  Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,<span id="line_501">&nbsp&nbsp[501]</span><br>
  With what I most enjoy contented least,<span id="line_502">&nbsp&nbsp[502]</span><br>
  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,<span id="line_503">&nbsp&nbsp[503]</span><br>
  Haply I think on thee, and then my state,<span id="line_504">&nbsp&nbsp[504]</span><br>
  (Like to the lark at break of day arising<span id="line_505">&nbsp&nbsp[505]</span><br>
  From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,  <span id="line_506">&nbsp&nbsp[506]</span><br>
    For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,<span id="line_507">&nbsp&nbsp[507]</span><br>
    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.<span id="line_508">&nbsp&nbsp[508]</span><br>
<span id="line_509">&nbsp&nbsp[509]</span><br>
<span id="line_510">&nbsp&nbsp[510]</span><br>
                     30<span id="line_511">&nbsp&nbsp[511]</span><br>
  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,<span id="line_512">&nbsp&nbsp[512]</span><br>
  I summon up remembrance of things past,<span id="line_513">&nbsp&nbsp[513]</span><br>
  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,<span id="line_514">&nbsp&nbsp[514]</span><br>
  And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:<span id="line_515">&nbsp&nbsp[515]</span><br>
  Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)<span id="line_516">&nbsp&nbsp[516]</span><br>
  For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,<span id="line_517">&nbsp&nbsp[517]</span><br>
  And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,<span id="line_518">&nbsp&nbsp[518]</span><br>
  And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.<span id="line_519">&nbsp&nbsp[519]</span><br>
  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,<span id="line_520">&nbsp&nbsp[520]</span><br>
  And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er<span id="line_521">&nbsp&nbsp[521]</span><br>
  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,<span id="line_522">&nbsp&nbsp[522]</span><br>
  Which I new pay as if not paid before.<span id="line_523">&nbsp&nbsp[523]</span><br>
    But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)<span id="line_524">&nbsp&nbsp[524]</span><br>
    All losses are restored, and sorrows end.<span id="line_525">&nbsp&nbsp[525]</span><br>
